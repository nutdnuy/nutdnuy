- Portfolio optimization techniques
- Algorithmic trading strategies
- Cutting-edge risk management approaches
- Novel quantitative research methodologies

## 🤖 Generative AI Adoption
I believe that Generative AI (GenAI) will be a defining force in shaping our future work environments. By blending productivity with creative insight, GenAI has the potential to transform entire industries. I enjoy exploring:
- Practical implementations of GenAI in various sectors
- Responsible AI frameworks and ethical considerations
- State-of-the-art language models and multimodal systems
